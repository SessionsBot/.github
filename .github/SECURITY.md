# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects and users seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

* **Preferred Method (GitHub Security Advisories):** Use the GitHub Security Advisories feature to privately report the vulnerability. This is the most secure and recommended way. You can initiate a private vulnerability report by going to the "Security" tab of the affected repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability."

* **Email:** If the GitHub Security Advisories feature is not suitable, you can send an email directly to [halting.credo.00@icloud.com](mailto:halting.credo.00@icloud.com). Please encrypt your email with our PGP key (available upon request or find it here: [link to your PGP key]).

**What to include in your report:**

* A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The affected version(s) of the project.
* Any proof-of-concept code or exploits.
* Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up).

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

* Acknowledging your report within 2 business days.
* Providing a full response (including a timeline for remediation) within 5 business days.
* Keeping you informed of our progress.
* Publicly acknowledging your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) once the vulnerability has been resolved.

Thank you for helping us keep our projects secure!
