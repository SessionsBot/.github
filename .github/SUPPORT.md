## 🐛 Found a Bug?

Only report bugs using [GitHub Issues](../../issues) **if**:

## 🚧 Working on a Task or Feature?

If you're contributing a feature or working on a dev task, create an Issue to track it. Please follow our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to do so.

## 🛡️ Reporting a Security Vulnerability?

Do **not** file public issues for security-related matters.

Instead, use GitHub’s private advisory system:

- 🔐 [Report a Security Vulnerability](../../security/advisories/new)
- 📃 [Our Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)
